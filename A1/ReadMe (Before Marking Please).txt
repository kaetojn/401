Hi Willie/Ramin,

I have implemented correctly (to the best of my ability) all parts of the assignment except for Part 3.3.

This is because I was unable to test out my code with the 40,000 records from preproc.json. During this assignment I used a small sized preproc.json so I could be more efficient with debugging.

I underestimated how long it could take to run a1_preproc.py and a1_extractFeatures.py. I am currently running the code on CDF and it is taking a very long time.

I have commented out all the code for Part 3.3 (Please dont deduct marks for messy/unclear code - but its fine if you do)

I am going to submit what I have so far for each of the *py files along with a1_3.1.csv, a1_3.2.csv, a1_3.4.csv (The logic and correlations should be the same just different values)

I will take the 10% penalty for the section 3.3 and submit the rest in the next 24 hours. I am not sure the CDF has version control to mark previously submitted versions so I will submit the a1_classify.py as a1_classify_late.py along with the updated csv files.

I already emailed the proffessor and he said that this is fine with him.

Apologies for any inconviniece this may cause you. Thank you and have a good day!

Cheers,
Kaeto
